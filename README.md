# Introduction

This project seeks to determine which regular-season factors can predict team success for 
Division I Men’s basketball teams—specifically related to NCAA March Madness tournament outcomes.

# Data and Variables 

The original dataset can be found on Kaggle.com, and it contains 23 statistics on over 300 Division I Men’s basketball teams. It 
contains data for the years 2013-2023, and it is updated each year after the tournament. The following variables are included in the dataset:

G: Number of games played\
W: Number of games won\
ADJOE: Adjusted Offensive Efficiency\
ADJDE: Adjusted Defensive Efficiency\
BARTHAG: Power Rating\
EFG_O: Effective Field Goal Percentage Shot\
EFG_D: Effective Field Goal Percentage Allowed\
TOR: Turnover Percentage Allowed\
TORD: Turnover Percentage Committed\
ORB: Offensive Rebound Rate\
DRB: Offensive Rebound Rate Allowed\
FTR : Free Throw Rate\
FTRD: Free Throw Rate Allowed\
2P_O: Two-Point Shooting Percentage\
2P_D: Two-Point Shooting Percentage Allowed\
3P_O: Three-Point Shooting Percentage\
3P_D: Three-Point Shooting Percentage Allowed\
ADJ_T: Adjusted Tempo (An estimate of the tempo (possessions per 40 minutes) a team would have against the team that wants to play at an average Division I tempo)
WAB: Wins Above Bubble\
POSTSEASON: Round where the given team was eliminated or where their season ended.\
SEED: Seed in the NCAA March Madness Tournament\
YEAR: Season

# Objectives 

The goals and objectives for the project include:
- Determine the effect of regular season statistics on postseason outcomes
- Determine patterns of upsets in March Madness. Is it truly random, or is there a pattern to underdogs winning?
- Compare regular season outcomes with postseason outcomes. Do they have the same trends?
- Develop a model to predict team outcomes for new seasons, regular and postseason
- Compare tournament outcomes across different seasons
